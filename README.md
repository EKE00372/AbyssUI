###### Donating the equivalent of one cup of coffee in your country each month can actually turn a hobby into a job. Check my paypal, thank you very much for your kindness.

#### AbyssUI is a minimalist World of Warcraft interface. It changes parts of the interface so you can have a more customizable and clean UI. The goals was to have a high customizable interface, that changes little to the wow artwork/functionality.

#### Hi, I'm Yugen (Brazil), I really like to work on this UI (I did spend too much time editing textures tho lol), I hope you like AbyssUI. If you want me to continue share with your friends, and please consider making a donation. This helps a lot and give me energy to make it even better! Thanks for all the support.

#### FAQ
##### - Some texture are looking/acting weird or Texture/Image is not right or cropped??
##### A: You are probably using a old texture version of AbyssUI, you need to download the new AbyssUI_TexturePack and things should be fixed (fresh installation, delete the old version).

##### - Buttons are gray or in another color instead of the default, and I don't want this?
##### A: Go to the AbyssUI options (/abyssui options) and check "Disable Button Color Text".

##### - I don't like the new buttons (white background), what should I do?
##### A: There's a folder named "zzBackup", copy the folders inside it, and replace them with the already on the interface folder.
##### After that, start the game, go to the AbyssUI options (/abyssui options) and check "Disable Button Color Text".

##### Please Report any bug.
